# DAM

Assets:

Generally the "asset" being managed is collected and stored in a digital format. 
There is usually a target version – referred to as "essence" – generally the highest-resolution and highest-fidelity representation. 
The asset is detailed by its metadata. Metadata is the description of the asset and the description depth can vary depending on the needs of the system, 
designer, or user. 
Metadata can describe, but is not limited to, the description of: 

    1. asset content (what is in the package?); 
    2. the means of encoding/decoding (e.g. JPEG, tar, MPEG 2); 
    3. provenance (history to point of capture); 
    4. ownership; 
    5. rights of access; 

as well as many others. 
There exist some predefined standards and template for metadata such as Dublin Core and PBCore. 
In cases of systems that contain large-size asset essences, such as MPEG 2 and JPEG2000 for the cases of images and video, 
there are usually related "proxy" copies of the essence. 
A proxy copy is a lower-resolution representation of the essence that can be used as a reference in order to reduce the overall bandwidth requirements of 
the DAM system infrastructure. 
It can be generated and retained at the time of ingestion of the asset simultaneous or subsequent to the essence, or it can be generated on the fly using transcoders.
